<h1>Nottingham Forest F.C.</h1>
<p>Nottingham  (or Nott'm for short.) is a small City in the East Midlands of England. Currently settling in 13th place of the England Barclays Premiership.<br> We have some histroy behind us!<br>
  winning 4 League cups, 2 UCLS, 2 European Cups, One UEFA Cup 2 FA cups, 1 FA Charity Shield. Recently Forest were promoted to the Premier League beating Sheffield UTD on penaltys and Huddersfeild 1-0 Ryan Yates scoring the opening and winning goal
  <br> My favorite moment ever is my first steps onto The City Ground. August 4 2019, Bracadale Road, Nottingham a little boy awaits to what will be his best day of his whole life. I was going to be a official Mascot to open up our 2019/10 season against West Brom.<br>
  I got to meet all the players, Manager, Coachers and even scored a goal for us. Took me 8 years, its taken my dad 44 years.<p>
