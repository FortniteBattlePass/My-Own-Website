<h1>Nottingham Forest F.C.</h1>
<p>Nottingham  (or Nott'm for short.) is a small City in the East Midlands of England. Currently settling in 13th place of the England Barclays Premiership.<br> We have some history behind us!<br>
  winning 4 League cups, 2 UCLS, 2 European Cups, One UEFA Cup 2 FA cups, 1 FA Charity Shield. Recently Forest were promoted to the Premier League beating Sheffield UTD on penaltys and Huddersfeild 1-0 Ryan Yates scoring the opening and winning goal
  <br> My favorite moment ever is my first steps onto The City Ground. August 4 2019, Bracadale Road, Nottingham a little boy awaits to what will be his best day of his whole life. I was going to be a official Mascot to open up our 2019/10 season against West Brom.<br>
  I got to meet all the players, Manager, Coachers and even scored a goal for us. Here is my top 5 favorite players including former players. <ol> Stan collymore, Brennan Johnson, Stuart Pearce, Joe lolley, Matty Cash. <h1> Did you know? <br> Over 10 players for NFFC played for their country in the World Cup 2022 Qatar!<br>
  <h4> Nottinghamshire haves 2 proffesinal football clubs, Notts County and Forest. Meadow Lane and City ground aren't even a mile away from each other. 0.26 Miles!! <br> While our proud but weak enemies Derby county are 13 Miles away. <h1> Did you know? <br> Meadow land and City ground are the closet staduims in England, 2nd in the UK <br> They are so close they aren't even allowed to play on the same day! ( only for home games )
